# Job and Product Management App / Deployment instructions above

This is a responsive job and product management application built with **React** and **SCSS**, allowing users to add, search, and delete jobs and products. The application includes dynamic tax and margin calculations.

## Features

- **Add/Remove Jobs**: Create new jobs with the option to add an extra margin. Jobs can be deleted dynamically.
- **Add/Remove Products**: Add products to jobs, specifying price and tax-free status. Products can be removed, updating the job's price accordingly.
- **Search Functionality**: Filter jobs and products via a search bar, updating results as you type.
- **Tax and Margin Calculations**: Automatically calculate sales tax (7%) and apply margin, with the option for an additional margin.
- **Mock Data**: The app includes mock jobs for testing purposes.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is fully responsive and optimized for mobile devices.
- **Components**: Custom toggle check box and Delete button are implemented


## Available Scripts / deploying locally

In the project directory in the terminal, you can run:

### `yarn start` to run the project locally

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
